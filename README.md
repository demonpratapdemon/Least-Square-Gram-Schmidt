Finding the solution to 'x' using Gram Schmidt  Orthogonalization and QR Factorization

Description
=====================================
Finding the solution to 'x' when it does not lie in the column space of A
Steps:
========
	1. Using Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization find Q
	2. Using QR Factorization and taking Q, find R
	3. Find x using the forumla
			**Rx = Q(T)b**, where Q(T) = Transpose of Q
